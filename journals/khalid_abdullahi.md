On the current day, our team had acquired a GitLab repository and commenced collaboration towards designing our application. Through active discussion and analysis, we were able to refine our initial concepts and converge towards a single Minimum Viable Product (MVP), while also outlining our desired future goals. During this process, we completed our team's code of conduct, while also establishing a clear vision for the appearance and functionality of a simple profile page utilizing the standard Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations.

Our daily routine commenced with a standup meeting, wherein each team member articulated their previous day's accomplishments and delineated their aspirations for the collective progression. Subsequently, we delved into the intricate process of wireframing, meticulously crafting the visual blueprint of our frontend interface. To further augment our development endeavors, we deliberated over the selection of a fitting data platform, such as SQL or MongoDB, with plans to reconvene the following day to finalize our well-informed decision.

Today, we engaged in a comprehensive deliberation regarding the selection of an appropriate database for our project, choosing between MongoDB and SQL. After thoroughly examining the salient features of both, we ultimately opted for MongoDB, given its remarkable scalability and abstract nature. Subsequently, we devoted our attention to finalizing the wireframing process and strategizing an effective approach to assimilate the requisite literature for the forthcoming day's endeavors.

Today, we reached a consensus on our modus operandi for situations wherein a team member undertakes work beyond the predetermined scope outside our regular meetings. To address such instances, we agreed to convene the following day for a stand-up meeting, during which each individual would elucidate their respective contributions, highlighting any instances of working ahead. In the event that a team member had indeed advanced the project, the entire group would meticulously examine the accomplished tasks, ensuring a collective comprehension of the progress and facilitating seamless collaboration as we proceed.
