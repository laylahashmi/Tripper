## March 20th, 2023:
Today we got our gitlab repository and collaborated on ideas for our application. We narrowed down our ideas to a single MVP and have outlined future stretch goals. We focused on our code of conduct and what a simple profile page will look like with CRUD.

## March 21st, 2023:
I presented a potential wireframe and we collaborated on adding additional features to it. I added the idea of a bucket list feature that would consist of a simple list view with an add/remove button. Today we started learning about FastAPI but have yet to implement it. We talked about researching the pros and cons of MongoDB and POSTGREsql, and what our push/pull protocols may look like.

We completed our wireframe today and made a few changes. The team wanted to add cards for stops rather than the same style of card for the trip. The first card will be about the trip that will include a summary, start and end date, trip name and a URL field. The URL field will allow the user to use an image of their choice to describe the trip. The other cards will use the pexel api to find images relating to the stop. Potential stretch goals include a bucket list view i suggested and changing the map view to be a world map rather than a US Map. An idea I had was to add icons on the map where the user has visited. The user would be able to click on the icon and it wuold take them to that specific trip. If we would like to incorporate the users mile's traveled we considered calculating miles traveled per trip and then add it to a counter on the users profile once the trip is finished. We are learning about API design today and will start collaborating on that tomorrow.

The majority of our day was spent on lectures about SQL and completing our resume drafts. The team decided to take notes on our API endpoints to begin writing them out tomorrow.

## March 24th, 2023:
We decided to stick with our decision with using the Mongo Database after today's lecture on MongoDB. We worked together to complete the api-design and updated our wireframe to include a home page for users who are not logged-in/signed-up. For this weekend we discussed reviewing the new material and writing our first issue.
