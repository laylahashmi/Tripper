Today we got our gitlab repository and collaborated on ideas for our application. We narrowed down our ideas to a single MVP and have outlined future stretch goals. We focused on our code of conduct and what a simple profile page will look like with CRUD.

## March 21st, 2023:
We worked on the wireframing for the application and brainstormed names. Ray thought of a great idea for a bucket list feature and we added it to the top of our stretch goals list. The wireframing needs an "add a stop/destination" form page added to it, and the "create trip" form needs to be modified. Nav bar might have optimization possibilities as well.

I just had a thought that the primary key for a user should be their name/user_id to make filtering with the search bar easier in the future. Going to bring it up in stand up later.

Wireframe is a masterpiece. I wrote down the structure our data will have based on the forms in the wireframe. The goal for the end of the day is to get a rough shape of the API, and then work towards a more structured design.

Layla clutched it today. She got a rough start on the api design yesterday, and shared her screen in zoom today while we all worked together to get the full design finished. All the necessary endpoints are drawn up as well as the shape of the request and return data for each one. Goals for the weekend are to get MongoDB implemented into my own branch, then work it into the main branch as a group on Monday. Once the db is set up we can start assigning issues for each group member and crush this project as a team.

Worked my butt off today on authorization, but we pulled through in the end. I hope my teammates aren't annoyed that I did so much outside of class, but it really wasnt a crazy amount. Everybody was super interested in my explanations for what got done, and they all listened very well and asked good questions. Tomorrow will be more fastAPI videos and small steps on the api endpoints.

Khalid absolutely killed it last night. Dude put up some wild code that gave me a panic attack, but we made it. Got half of the endpoints done as a team, and finishing the rest tomorrow :D.
