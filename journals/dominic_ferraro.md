Today we got our gitlab repository and collaborated on ideas for our application. We narrowed down our ideas to a single MVP and have outlined future stretch goals. We focused on our code of conduct and what a simple profile page will look like with CRUD.

We worked on the wireframing for the application and brainstormed names. Ray thought of a great idea for a bucket list feature and we added it to the top of our stretch goals list. The wireframing needs an "add a stop/destination" form page added to it, and the "create trip" form needs to be modified. Nav bar might have optimization possibilities as well.
