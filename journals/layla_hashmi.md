Today we formed our groups and began brainstorming application ideas for our project. Through our collaboration, we decided to build an application which tracks a user's trips- a trip journal. We outlined what our MVP will be and began to design the CRUD layout.

On this current day, we did our standup during which each team member discussed what they had accomplished the previous day and their goals for the day ahead. Ray had worked on a wireframe design for the application the night before, which they presented. The team collaborated to add/include certain features. Our goal for tonight is to continue increasing our knowledge of FastAPI and additionally, to do research on MongoDB/PostgreSQL in the hopes that it will help us in coming to a consensus of which database to use for our application.
