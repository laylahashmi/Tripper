Today we formed our groups and began brainstorming application ideas for our project. Through our collaboration, we decided to build an application which tracks a user's trips- a trip journal. We outlined what our MVP will be and began to design the CRUD layout.

On this current day, we did our standup during which each team member discussed what they had accomplished the previous day and their goals for the day ahead. Ray had worked on a wireframe design for the application the night before, which they presented. The team collaborated to add/include certain features. Our goal for tonight is to continue increasing our knowledge of FastAPI and additionally, to do research on MongoDB/PostgreSQL in the hopes that it will help us in coming to a consensus of which database to use for our application.

Spoke to SEIRS about our project and shared wireframe. During the discussion, we discovered that it would be a good idea to have a "Welcome" page. From this page we would be able to login or signup for an account. The page would also contain a brief description and mockups of the features that the app offers. Perhaps in the footer we can include info about the team members as well. I added this idea to the wireframe and uploaded to our VSC file for the application.

I also worked on the API design and outlined some endpoints that I think will be necessary for the app. This will be shared with the team tomorrow during standup where we will all compare our notes about the API design and work together to create a draft of what we want them to look like.
